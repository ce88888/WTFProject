# ~~~~ TO BE DONE
# Note - ToD for FAA is meant to describe light conditions, so we can't simply map from Time field as the light conditions will shift over the course of the year. We can try to source dawn/dusk times for KDEN, but not sure if that is really helpful
# Aircrew in the end will want to know a particular time slot - but
# We have 286 populated TOD fields where we are missing time for KDEN, so worth at least approximating
# More importantly, we are missing 4044 time fields, where we could only go to the day

# ~~~~ DISCUSS
# Our Time of Day - do we have research which motivates distinct periods birds prefer to fly or not? ... in hot locations it may be that they dont' fly over lunch, but in Denver they may? FOR NOW (change in function if we want to update as this is used further down)
# morning 6 - 9 -> hours 6,7,8
# day 9 - 18 -> hours 9 - 17
# evening 18 - 20 -> hours 18, 19
# night 20 - 6 -> hours 20 - 5
# UNKNOWN = NO TIME IN FAA FILE
