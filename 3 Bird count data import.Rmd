```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(padr)

`%!in%` = Negate(`%in%`)
`%+%` <- function(x,y) str_c(x,y)
```

### Purpose  
This file contains code to read the e-bird birdcount export and to save it as an RDS file.

Note that import and clean-up should not restrict the date range, as this should be done during model training, as appropriate.

## To do:
* Future refinement re getting bird count data directly from API for different airports

```{r Bird numbers}
# Note - currently only have daily data, so for now set RTIME to NA
data_birdcounts <- read.csv("birdCount_Aggregated.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::select(DATE = observationDate, COUNT = birdCount) %>%
  mutate(DATE = ymd(DATE), RTIME=NA) %>%
  mutate(`AIRPORT ID` = as.factor("KDEN"))

saveRDS(data_birdcounts, "KDEN Birdcounts.RDS")

rm(data_birdcounts)
```
